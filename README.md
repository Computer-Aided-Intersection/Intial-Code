# Computer Aided Intersection Calculator
A respository that correlates with cars to find the optimal way to get the car through the intersection without stopping.
# Computer Aided Intersection Calculator Overview
The goal of this program is to have a computer communicate with on coming cars before they reach an intersection to optimize traffic lights.
It does this by gathering the velocity of the car, distance of the car from the middle of the intersection, and the acceleration of said vehicle.
The code will group cars together to make them the most effcient and then calculate at what speed the vehicle will need to be set to make
it so the cars will never have to stop at the intersections.
